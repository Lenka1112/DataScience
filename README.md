# run_analysis script readme
The run_analysis script merges and analyses the test and train data gathered from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The script does it in a few main steps:

1) Reading the test data, labeling it and appending the activites and subject columns (code lines 1-11)

2) Reading the train data, labeling it and appending the activites and subject columns (code lines 12-20)

3) Merging the train and test datasets into "combinedData" (code line 21)

4) Creating a dataset "filteredData" of only mean() and std() variables (code lines 22-27)

5) Creating a dataset "summaryData" with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (code lines 28-30)
